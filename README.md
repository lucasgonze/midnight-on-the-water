# midnight-on-the-water
MuseScore sheet music / chart for old time standard "Midnight on the Water".

Created using MuseScore - binary at musescore.org, source at http://github.com/musescore/MuseScore. 

I created this as follows:

1. Introduced to the song by a fiddler I was jamming with
2. Listened to a bunch of versions in Spotify
3. Dug around the Internet for sheet music and picked out four different versions
4. Instead of playing just one version, played them all, one after the other
5. Tidied up those four loose printouts by retranscribing using MuseScore
