# midnight-on-the-water
MuseScore sheet music / chart for old time standard "Midnight on the Water".

Sample performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoIZWBkzxHg

Created using MuseScore (binary at musescore.org, source at http://github.com/musescore/MuseScore).

I created this as follows:

1. Introduced to the song by a fiddler I was jamming with
2. Listened to a bunch of versions in Spotify
3. Dug around the Internet for sheet music and found four distinct versions
4. Instead of playing just one version, played them all, one after the other
5. Tidied up those four loose printouts by retranscribing into a single document

You might play all four together, or just use them for ideas about how to play it your own way.

About the copyrights involved, here's what I know. The original is generally credited to somebody named Luke Thomasson. I couldn't find any info about that person except that he was the father of the fiddler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Thomasson">Benny Thomasson</a>. Benny was born in 1909, so it's a good bet that the his father's composition predated the dawn of infinite copyright around 1927 and has passed into the public domain.  The four versions that I found floating around and pulled into here could have fresh copyrights created as a result of creative license, but none of them carried a copyright notice or author aside from Luke Thomasson, so their interpreters probably have no intention of claiming copyright. I didn't keep track of where I found them. Any copyright on my own work is dedicated to the public domain using Creative Commons Zero license in this repo.

I got the 160 tempo from the recording by Benny Thomasson.
